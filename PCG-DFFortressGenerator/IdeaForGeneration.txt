Generating rooms:
	1. Dig empty rooms of 4x4x1 until half of dwarves can do stuff.
	   Dig path from room to entrance (or room/path that connects to entrance) every time a room is dug.
	2. Assign room types to rooms.

Objective function:
	* Distance between buildings that have relations
	* Score per building of what we need (negative if we're missing a building that was requested)

Mutation:
	Pick room and decide (randomly) if it is to be changed into another random type of room.
