Most PCG tools are made with the intention to help the developer reduce costs or be integrated into the games themselves. In this paper we present a PCG tool for generating layouts of fortresses for the game Dwarf Fortress using evolutionary programming. Our results show that our method generates useful maps, but that it is too slow when generating fortresses that can hold a large number of dwarves.
