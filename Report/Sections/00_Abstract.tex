Most PCG tools are made with the intention to help the developer or be integrated into the games themselves. In this paper we present a PCG tool for generating layouts of fortresses for the game Dwarf Fortress using evolutionary programming. Our results show that our method generates useful maps, but that it is tool slow to use for a large number of dwarves.
