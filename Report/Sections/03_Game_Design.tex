Whatâ€™s the design of the game you are going to use? Why do you need PCG in this game?

Design: Tile-based map where you are the leader of a dwarven expedition. You tell the dwarves what to do and attempt to build a huge fortress in which they can live and thrive.

PCG: Because coming up with a fortress layout can be very difficult, especially for new players. Having an idea of how to create a fortress would be an immense help.
